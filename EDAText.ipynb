    "### 1.4 Analytical Focus\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected attributes capture **three complementary perspectives** of social engagement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Content and Language**\n",
    "   - `title`, `text`  \n",
    "   → used to explore trending topics, keywords, and sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Behavioral Engagement**\n",
    "   - `likes`, `shares`, `comments`, `views`, `engagement_total`  \n",
    "   → used to measure virality and audience reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contextual & Demographic Information**\n",
    "   - `platform`, `source_type`, `identity_gender`, `identity_city`, `created_date`  \n",
    "   → used to identify *where*, *who*, and *when* content was generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Data Quality Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset includes some **text noise** such as emojis, hashtags, and informal language.  \n",
    "- `identity_gender` and `identity_city` are partially missing (≈70–80% unknown).  \n",
    "- Engagement counts show **high variance**, with a few viral posts having very large values.  \n",
    "  → Outlier handling and log-scaling will be required in the preprocessing step.  \n",
    "- Non-ASCII Vietnamese characters are retained for linguistic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Planned Visual Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "The following charts will be used to describe dataset characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Visualization | Purpose |\n",
    "|----------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Platform distribution** | Show share of posts by platform (Facebook vs TikTok). |\n",
    "| **Source type distribution** | Compare content origin: user vs fanpage vs group. |\n",
    "| **Post volume over time** | Visualize daily activity and detect viral peaks. |\n",
    "| **Engagement histogram** | Display skewness in interaction counts. |\n",
    "| **Top sources by engagement** | Identify most influential accounts or pages. |\n",
    "| **Gender/City breakdown (if available)** | Explore simple demographic distribution. |\n",
    "\n",
    "These exploratory visuals help establish an understanding of the dataset’s coverage  \n",
    "before progressing to **data preparation, sentiment classification, and engagement modeling** in later sections.\n"
